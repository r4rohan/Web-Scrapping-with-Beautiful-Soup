# Web-Scrapper-with-Beautiful-Soup

Simple Web Scrapping in Python with Beautiful Soup, a python library for pulling out HTML and XML data from website.
After pulling all the data are stored in CSV file, for convenience I have added a csv file in which my portfolio (https://rohansinghkalhans.firebaseapp.com) data is storing.

### It's not a universal template but it reduces your work to some extent.
